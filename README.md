# Nathan Maine

**Senior Technical Program Manager | AI Agent Builder | Enterprise Delivery**

I deliver enterprise platforms that power critical business outcomes — from identity systems serving 700K users to data platforms unifying 89M records across 28+ sources. I've led $20M+ portfolios at Salesforce with 5/5 CSAT and cut delivery cycles by 67%.

Now building AI tooling that eliminates the bottlenecks I've spent a career navigating.

## 🛠️ AI Agent Toolkit

Open-source tools for building production-grade AI agents. Each project solves a real problem I encountered deploying agentic AI in enterprise environments.

### [Governance Graph Compiler](https://github.com/NathanMaine/governance-graph-compiler)
> Automated compliance mapping — controls to evidence, instantly

**The problem:** Enterprise compliance teams spend weeks manually mapping controls to evidence across spreadsheets. Auditors ask "show me proof for control X" and teams scramble.

**The solution:** A graph-based engine that ingests control frameworks and evidence sources, then automatically maps relationships. Query any control, get linked evidence instantly.

### [Agentic Evaluation Sandbox](https://github.com/NathanMaine/agentic-evaluation-sandbox)
> Regression testing for AI agents — QA for non-deterministic systems

**The problem:** AI agents are non-deterministic. The same prompt can produce different outputs. Traditional testing doesn't work. Teams ship agents without confidence they'll behave correctly.

**The solution:** A sandbox that runs agents through scenario batteries, captures outputs, compares against baselines, and flags regressions. Treats agent evaluation like software QA — repeatable, measurable, automated.

### [Agentic Memory Graph Engine](https://github.com/NathanMaine/agentic-memory-graph-engine)
> Persistent, queryable memory for AI agents

**The problem:** Most AI agents are stateless. They forget everything between conversations. Building agents that remember context, learn from interactions, and maintain knowledge over time is hard.

**The solution:** A graph-based memory architecture that stores interactions as structured nodes and edges. Agents can query their own history, retrieve relevant context, and build on past work.

### [Self-Healing Agentic Workflows](https://github.com/NathanMaine/self-healing-agentic-workflows)
> Fault tolerance for AI pipelines — agents that recover instead of crash

**The problem:** AI agents fail. APIs timeout, LLMs hallucinate, tools break. Most agent frameworks crash or hang when things go wrong. Production agents need to be reliable, not brittle.

**The solution:** A pattern library for building fault-tolerant agent workflows. Automatic retries with backoff, graceful degradation, fallback chains, and circuit breakers.
